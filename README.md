# Visualization-Project-DS745
Use of Tableau to highlight a counter-intuitive trend in the data in three different ways

The first viz just shows that not all high sales amounts come with high profits.

The second viz is more multivariate. It shows Sales by Profit. The bubble size indicates the discount amount on an order. As we can see by the position and color of the bubbles, there is a correlation between bigger discounts and bigger losses.

The third viz more clearly aggregates the data points to show a clear link between deep discounts and deep losses.
